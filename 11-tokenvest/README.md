# 🚀 TokenVest: Trustless On-Chain Token Vesting Vaults

TokenVest is a premium decentralized token vesting and lockup system built on the Stellar network and Soroban smart contracts. It enables founders, startups, and investors to secure vesting schedules, set cliff gates, and claim unlocked tokens progressively via cryptographic multi-signature validation.
